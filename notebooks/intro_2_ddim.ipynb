    "# Denoising diffusion implicit models\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a follow-up of the [DDPM introduction](intro_1_ddpm.ipynb) and provides a brief discussion of **denoising diffusion implicit models** (DDIMs). They have been introduced in [[Song et al., 2021](https://openreview.net/forum?id=St1giarCHLP)] as a generalization of DDPMs. In particular, a non-Markovian noising process is constructed such that it features exactly the same marginals as in the strictly Markovian DDPM formulation. While this leads to the same training objective, it also allows for skipping steps in the generative process. This way the sampling procedure is accelerated."

    "In [[Song et al., 2021](https://openreview.net/forum?id=St1giarCHLP)] a family of non-Markovian noising processes $q_{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}(\\boldsymbol{x}_{1:T} | \\boldsymbol{x}_0)$, indexed by a vector $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_1, \\ldots, \\sigma_T)$ with $\\sigma_t \\geq 0$ for all $t = 1, \\ldots, T$, has been proposed. No matter the exact values of those hyperparameters, the process has the same marginal $q_{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}(\\boldsymbol{x}_t | \\boldsymbol{x}_0) = \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{x}_t | \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\boldsymbol{x}_0, (1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t) \\boldsymbol{I})$ as in the strictly Markovian DDPM formulation.

If the model $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(\\boldsymbol{x}_t, t)$ does not share parameters over different $t$, which means that $t$ is an index of the model rather than an input, both training objectives are perfectly equivalent. The reason is that the loss terms are independent from each other.\n",
